**Description**

Implement the `fetch()` member method to perform the fetch part of the simulations fetch-execute cycle.  Fetching is conceptually simpler than executing.  Use the value of the PC program counter to fetch the indicated instruction from memory and load it into the IR instruction register.

**Suggested Solution**


**Additional Requirements**

- You are required to reuse `peekAddress()` in the fetch, to get the instruction from the memory location indicated by the current PC.
