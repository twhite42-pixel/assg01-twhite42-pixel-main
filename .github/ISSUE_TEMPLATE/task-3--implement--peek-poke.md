**Description**

Implement the two member methods used to write values into simulated memory and read values back out of the simulated memory.  These member methods expect an address in the simulated machine address space.  These methods will reuse the `translateAddress()` member method to translate the virtual simulation address into the correct memory index / address.

**Suggested Solution**


**Additional Requirements**

- You are required to reuse the implementation of `translateAddress()` for both of these member functions.
- The `peekAddress()` function does not change the state of the hypothetical machine, thus it must be a `const` member function.
