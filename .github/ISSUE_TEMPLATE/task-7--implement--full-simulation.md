**Description**

Enable full simulations by finishing the `runSimulation()` member method.  You have been given the code for this task, but it is commented out at the start of the assignment.  Once you have the fetch and execute member methods correctly working, you should be able to uncomment the `runSimulation()` method to perform full simulations.
