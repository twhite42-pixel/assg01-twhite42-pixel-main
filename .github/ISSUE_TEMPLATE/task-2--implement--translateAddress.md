**Description**

Implement the `translateAddress()` simulation member function.  This function translates from a simulated address space, into a real address / real index into the `memory` member variable.

**Suggested Solution**


**Additional Requirements**

- Error checking should be done again in this function.  If the requested address is below the base address or above the bounds address, an exception must be thrown.
- This function does not change the state of the hypothetical machine.  Thus it is required to be a `const` member function.
